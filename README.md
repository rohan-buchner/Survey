This is a small survey I worked on to test how feasible it was to swap over to completely cloud based dev environments...
The solution is running on 
  * Cloud9 (IDE)
  * Bitbucket (Source Control)
  * CodeShip (CI)
  * Heroku (App Platform)

How to Run:

* install environment dependencies 
  * npm install grunt -g
  * npm install bower -g

* install solution dependencies
  * npm install

* get solution bower packages
  * bower install

* magic (hopefully)
  * grunt serve
