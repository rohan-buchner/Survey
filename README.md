This is a small survey I worked on to test how feasible it was to swap over to completely cloud based dev environments...
The solution is running on 
  Cloud9 (IDE)
  Bitbucket (Source Control)
  CodeShip (CI)
  Heroku (App Platform)

How to Run:

* install environment dependencies 
  * npm install grunt -g
  * npm install bower -g

* install solution dependencies
  * npm install

* get solution bower packages
  * bower install

* magic (hopefully)
  * grunt serve
